    <h3>Klub 85</h3>
    <p>The Klub 85  is a student and alumni network for students of the University of Fribourg.  This special association was founded in 1985 by a group of domestic and foreign  students living and studying in Fribourg.<br>
      The idea of  the founders of the Klub was to bring together a group of tolerant, ambitious  and dynamic students, which political or religious views and visions should not  be limited to a certain direction. The goal was to help each other in their  studies, to party and have fun together and thus to create life lasting  friendships - this still holds today.<br>
    The  creation of the Klub made sure that everyone sees each other at least once a  year for an event in order to make sure these friendships do not end up in fading  long distance acquaintances. The nationality or origin do not matter for the  admission. What counts is personality, character and commitment of the young  student. It is on this basis that the friendships are created which are  essential to the Klub 85. This international network works and the community  holds for a life time.</p><div align="center">

    <h3><a id="Veranstaltungen"></a>Events</h3>
    <p>The Klub 85  also holds public events, these essentially consist of lectures from senior  members of the economy, the arts and politics as well as company visits which  serve as orientation for the time after the studies. This opens opportunities  to get to know interesting individuals from other study tracks or professional  branches.<br>
    The second  main goal of the Klub is to host exciting parties for the students of Fribourg  to spice up the else rather dull and monotonic party life. Events like the  traditional motto parties, the legendary forestparty and the glamorous  Christmasball are key events in everybody's party agenda.</p>
<h3>Active  Members</h3>
    <p>The Klub  currently consists of nine active members coming from four different countries,  all studying at the University of Fribourg.  </p>
